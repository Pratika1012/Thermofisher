      "Appendix II, of the Medical Devices Rules, 2017. \n",
      "The TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators are high-performance blood bank refrigerators designed to meet strict \n",
      "requirements established by the AABB for the storage of whole blood and blood components. AABB (formerly \n",
      "known as the \"American Association of Blood Banks\") fosters advancements in transfusion medicine and \n",
      "biotherapies by providing standards, accreditation and educational programs focused on optimizing patient \n",
      "and donor care and safety. \n",
      "The TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators are Class B non-invasive, non-sterile, reusable devices. The devices are \n",
      "not intended to directly contact patients but users are anticipated to have direct contact with device components \n",
      "(e.g. door handle, door, shelving, chart recorder) via their hand (intact skin). Duration of contact is anticipated \n",
      "to be transient (i.e., continuous use < 60 minutes) but cumulative exposure may be considered as short term \n",
      "(i.e. continuous use between 60 minutes and 30 days). \n",
      "The TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators are available in Europe, United States, Canada and APAC region with \n",
      "more than 437 units sold since their first commercialization in 2017. The data presented in this Device Master \n",

      "High-performance refrigeration has a significant beneficial role in blood product storage. The storage of blood \n",
      "and blood components in appropriate controlled conditions (e.g. blood bank refrigerator) is a key element of \n",
      "an effective blood cold chain responsible for transporting blood and blood products from donor collection \n",
      "through patient transfusion. Improper storage temperature conditions can affect the safety, purity, potency and \n",
      "quality of blood or blood components. Such deviations from established storage conditions can affect the \n",
      "constituents of blood components leading to reduced clinical benefits and potential patient transfusion \n",
      "reactions. The potential risk of temperature deviation is common to all blood cold chain equipment, including \n",
      "the TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators and its alternatives. No significant side-effects related to use of the TSX \n",
      "Blood Bank Refrigerators were identified. Considering the pre-clinical data, literature data included for safety \n",

      "accordance with Appendix II, of the Medical Devices Rules, 2017. \n",
      "The TDE series are Ultra-low temperature (-86Â°C) freezers designed to meet strict \n",
      "requirements established by the AABB and EDQM for the storage of plasma. AABB (formerly \n",
      "known as the âAmerican Association of Blood Banksâ) foster advancements in transfusion and \n",
      "transplantation medicine and biotherapies respectively by providing standards, accreditation \n",
      "and educational programs focused on optimizing patient and donor care safety.  \n",
      "The TDE series Ultra-Low Temperature Freezers are Class B non-invasive, non-sterile, \n",
      "reusable devices. The devices are not intended to directly contact patients but users are \n",
      "anticipated to have direct contact with device components (e.g. door handle, door, shelving, \n",
      "chart recorder) via their hand (intact skin). Duration of contact is anticipated to be transient \n",
      "(i.e., continuous use < 60 minutes) but cumulative exposure may be considered as short term \n",
      "(i.e. continuous use between 60 minutes and 30 days). \n",
      "The TDE series Ultra-Low Temperature Freezers are recently launched in 2019 . The data \n",
      "presented in this Device Master File comprises Device Description, Specifications, pre-clinical \n",
      "data (verification and validation, and relevant bench test reports), Clinical Evaluation Report \n",
      "with 16 publications contributing to state of the art/current knowledge (of which 12 are \n",

      "Ultra-low temperature freezers have a significant role in blood product and storage. The storage \n",
      "of blood components (e.g. plasma, red blood cells) in appropriate controlled conditions is a key \n",
      "element of an effective blood cold chain responsible for transporting blood products from donor \n",
      "collection through patient transfusion and transplantation. Improper storage conditions can \n",
      "affect the safety, purity, potency and quality of blood components. Such deviations from \n",
      "established storage conditions can affect the constituents of blood components and their \n",
      "integrity, leading to reduced clinical benefits and potential patient transfusion/implantation \n",

      "the state of the art, the PMS data retrieved from the internal Thermo Fisher database as well as \n",

      "refrigerant with lower boiling point (a mixture of R170 and R290 in this unit) is used. The low \n",
      "stage system will absorb the heat from the cabinet where samples are stored and reject it to the \n",
      "high stage system through the inter-stage heat exchanger. The high stage system will then reject \n",
      "the heat to the ambient. The refrigerants in these two systems do not mix with each other and \n",
      "operate as separate refrigeration circuit. The heat exchanger between the two systems only \n",
      "connects them thermally without any exchange of refrigerants.  \n",
      "The refrigerant in low stage system boils in the evaporator which is connected the cabinet and \n",
