      "The TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators are high-performance blood bank refrigerators designed to meet strict \n",
      "requirements established by the AABB for the storage of whole blood and blood components. AABB (formerly \n",
      "known as the \"American Association of Blood Banks\") fosters advancements in transfusion medicine and \n",
      "biotherapies by providing standards, accreditation and educational programs focused on optimizing patient \n",
      "and donor care and safety. \n",
      "The TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators are Class B non-invasive, non-sterile, reusable devices. The devices are \n",
      "not intended to directly contact patients but users are anticipated to have direct contact with device components \n",
      "(e.g. door handle, door, shelving, chart recorder) via their hand (intact skin). Duration of contact is anticipated \n",
      "to be transient (i.e., continuous use < 60 minutes) but cumulative exposure may be considered as short term \n",
      "(i.e. continuous use between 60 minutes and 30 days). \n",
      "The TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators are available in Europe, United States, Canada and APAC region with \n",
      "more than 437 units sold since their first commercialization in 2017. The data presented in this Device Master \n",

      "High-performance refrigeration has a significant beneficial role in blood product storage. The storage of blood \n",
      "and blood components in appropriate controlled conditions (e.g. blood bank refrigerator) is a key element of \n",
      "an effective blood cold chain responsible for transporting blood and blood products from donor collection \n",
      "through patient transfusion. Improper storage temperature conditions can affect the safety, purity, potency and \n",
      "quality of blood or blood components. Such deviations from established storage conditions can affect the \n",
      "constituents of blood components leading to reduced clinical benefits and potential patient transfusion \n",
      "reactions. The potential risk of temperature deviation is common to all blood cold chain equipment, including \n",
      "the TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators and its alternatives. No significant side-effects related to use of the TSX \n",
      "Blood Bank Refrigerators were identified. Considering the pre-clinical data, literature data included for safety \n",

      "accordance with Appendix II, of the Medical Devices Rules, 2017. \n",
      "The TDE series are Ultra-low temperature (-86°C) freezers designed to meet strict \n",
      "requirements established by the AABB and EDQM for the storage of plasma. AABB (formerly \n",
      "known as the “American Association of Blood Banks”) foster advancements in transfusion and \n",
      "transplantation medicine and biotherapies respectively by providing standards, accreditation \n",
      "and educational programs focused on optimizing patient and donor care safety.  \n",
      "The TDE series Ultra-Low Temperature Freezers are Class B non-invasive, non-sterile, \n",
      "reusable devices. The devices are not intended to directly contact patients but users are \n",
      "anticipated to have direct contact with device components (e.g. door handle, door, shelving, \n",
      "chart recorder) via their hand (intact skin). Duration of contact is anticipated to be transient \n",
      "(i.e., continuous use < 60 minutes) but cumulative exposure may be considered as short term \n",
      "(i.e. continuous use between 60 minutes and 30 days). \n",
      "The TDE series Ultra-Low Temperature Freezers are recently launched in 2019 . The data \n",

      "data (verification and validation, and relevant bench test reports), Clinical Evaluation Report \n",
      "with 16 publications contributing to state of the art/current knowledge (of which 12 are \n",

      "Ultra-low temperature freezers have a significant role in blood product and storage. The storage \n",
      "of blood components (e.g. plasma, red blood cells) in appropriate controlled conditions is a key \n",
      "element of an effective blood cold chain responsible for transporting blood products from donor \n",
      "collection through patient transfusion and transplantation. Improper storage conditions can \n",

      "• Never load the blood bank beyond capacity. The number of 450 ml bags\n",
      "that are recommended for your unit can be found in Table2.\n",
      "• Distribute the load as evenly as possible. Temperature uniformity\n",
      "depends on air circulation, which could be impeded if the drawers are\n",
      "overfilled, particularly at the top of the cabinet.\n",
      "• For critical applications such as blood storage, be sure that the alarm\n",
      "systems are working and active before you load any product.\n",
      "• Ensure clearance between the top of the cargo and the bottom of the\n",
      "shelf/drawer/basket. Lack of clearance may affect unit performance or\n",
      "impede operation of drawer/basket. Keep cargo within the bounds of\n",
      "the shelf/drawer/basket.\n",
      "Thermo Scientific TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators 23• For initial product loading and after removing the drawers for cleaning,\n",
      "be sure to load the unit from the bottom drawer up to ensure the\n",
      "drawers are seated properly.\n",
      "• Only open one drawer or basket at a time.\n",
      "• Avoid disrupting the thermal bottle(s) when repositioning interior\n",
      "components.\n",
      "• The floor of the cabinet should not be loaded.\n",
      "• Never load the unit above the load limit line. This is important to\n",

      "8.2 Product Loading and When loading your blood bank refrigerator, take care to observe the following\n",
      "Unloading Guidelines guidelines:\n",
      "• Never load the blood bank beyond capacity. The number of 450 ml bags\n",
      "that are recommended for your unit can be found in Table2.\n",
      "• Distribute the load as evenly as possible. Temperature uniformity\n",
      "depends on air circulation, which could be impeded if the drawers are\n",
      "overfilled, particularly at the top of the cabinet.\n",
      "• For critical applications such as blood storage, be sure that the alarm\n",
      "systems are working and active before you load any product.\n",
      "• Ensure clearance between the top of the cargo and the bottom of the\n",
      "shelf/drawer/basket. Lack of clearance may affect unit performance or\n",
      "impede operation of drawer/basket. Keep cargo within the bounds of\n",
      "the shelf/drawer/basket.\n",
      "Thermo Scientific TSX Blood Bank Refrigerators 23\n",
      "• For initial product loading and after removing the drawers for cleaning,\n",
      "be sure to load the unit from the bottom drawer up to ensure the\n",
      "drawers are seated properly.\n",
      "• Only open one drawer or basket at a time.\n",
      "• Avoid disrupting the thermal bottle(s) when repositioning interior\n",
      "components.\n",
      "• The floor of the cabinet should not be loaded.\n",
      "• Never load the unit above the load limit line. This is important to\n",
